Based on the jQuery plugin Socialite (found here: http://www.socialitejs.com/), WPSocialite makes page loading the most important factor when using social networking tools. Rather than load all of the basic sharing features along with the rest of the website, WPSocialite allows you to lazyload the sharing elements, making your website load faster and increase overall performance.
