# Socialite

## Because if you're selling your soul, you may as well do it asynchronously.

Socialite provides a very easy way to implement and activate a plethora of social sharing buttons at any time you wish.

### Functions

	Socialite.load();

`load` with no arguments load will search the document for elements with the class `socialise` and magically transform them into sharing buttons.
